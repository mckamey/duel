<p>DUEL is a <strong>"dual-side" templating</a> engine</strong> (client-side and server-side)
    using <strong>HTML for layout</strong> and
    <strong>100% pure JavaScript as the binding language</strong>. The same views may be executed <em>both</em>
    directly in the browser (client-side template) <em>and</em> on the server (server-side template).
</p>
<p>The goal of DUEL is to leverage knowledge in existing technologies to build UI for Ajax web applications. Modern
    apps require a fluid UI meaning an investment in JavaScript. DUEL takes this one step further by enabling
    JavaScript to build the entire view. Less context switching means focusing on the real problems rather than
    fighting the tools.</p>
<h3><em>In the browser…</em></h3>
<p>The view becomes a JavaScript function which accepts the data to bind as an argument. Returned is a result which
    can be used as either a string or to produce DOM elements directly. DUEL works great with your favorite
    JavaScript library (e.g. jQuery).</p>
<h3><em>On the server…</em></h3>
<p>The view is translated into a class which may be natively executed on the server without requiring a JavaScript
    execution environment. If any code blocks require being executed on the client they will be automatically
    delegated to the client. Initially, DUEL targets Java as the server language. Goals for the future include
    expansion into other environments as well.</p>
<h3><em><a href="syntax.html">Syntax</a></em></h3>
<p>The <a href="syntax.html">syntax for DUEL
        views</a> is designed to be familiar, concise and easy to remember.</p>
<h3><em><a href="examples.html">Examples</a></em></h3>
<p>See <a href="examples.html">examples of how
        easy it is</a> to define and use DUEL views.</p>
<h3><em>History</em></h3>
<p>DUEL is an evolution of previous view template technologies that began in 2006 with <a
        href="http://jsonml.org/">JsonML</a>. JsonML paved
    the way for JBST which was an early client-side template technology. After several years of real world usage,
    DUEL is the refinement of the good ideas of JBST while adding a viable server-side companion to the concept.</p>
